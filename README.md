# A Basic English-To-Hebrew Dictionary Built As An Anki Deck

This repository contains an English to Hebrew card deck providing translations in Hebrew of some commonly used words in the technology industry.

This resource is intended to be useful to those learning Hebrew and looking for specialist vocabulary, perhaps to help them at work. 

The lexicon of technology is vast and ever-changing and compiling even a remotely authoritative list of words is probably an impossible undertaking. 

Every best attempt has been made in compiling this information, but the author takes no responsibility arising from any inaccuracies or coworker embarassment arising from any part of the translation, including transliterations.

## Intended Usage:

## Download Anki

1. Download [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android)
